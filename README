This is an extension to the Freebase Gridworks application to provide a 
"Load into Talis Platform" option.

The extension builds on the RDF schema alignment and export features available 
in the latest builds of Gridworks, and essentially just provides an additional 
menu item and dialog for uploading data into a Talis Platform store.

This initial version allows the RDF generated to be posted into any store. There 
are a number of rough edges including the user interface, interaction and error handling. 

(I've also not sorted out the build system, have been relying on Eclipse to build 
classes.) 

The main current limitation is dealing with uploads of large data files. Currently 
uploads to Platform stores of more than 3-4MB need to be chunked into smaller files. 
However up to that size data should be loaded without problem.

To use the extension you'll need to do the following:

Grab a copy of this code, e.g. checking it out to:

 ~/tools/gridworks-talisplatform

Checkout the latest version of Gridworks from SVN, e.g. to:

 ~/tools/gridworks
 
Edit the following file:

 ~/tools/main/webapp/WEB-INF/butterfly.properties
 
To add the following line additional module path. Note you'll probably need to 
use an explicit path:

butterfly.modules.path = /home/ldodds/tools/gridworks-talisplatform

Then you can run Gridworks as normal:

./gridworks

If the module is successfully loaded then you should see a new menu item:

Schemas -> Load into Talis Platform...

You'll only be able to access the dialog if you've already mapped your data to an 
RDF schema.

A preview will be shown in the dialog, and you'll be prompted for the URI of your 
store and your username and password.
